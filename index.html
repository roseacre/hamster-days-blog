				<h2><a href="html/posts/30dayswild/20170610_Day10.html">A Japanese streamer...</a></h2>
				<p class="lead">will soon be blowing in the wind.</p>

				<p>It's Day 10 of    
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a>, a wet one for my little Girl Guide who is away
				at camp. I knew she was wise to pack lots of waterproofs.</p>
				
				<p>The rest of my human family aren't at Waddecar enjoying nature. They're not even inclined to go outside
				in Blackpool. One of the little humans has invited her friends to visit so they can watch films. I suspect they
				won't be watching anything I can tell you about for 30 Days Wild. But I'm hoping they might spare me a bit of
				popcorn.</p>

				<p>Some of the other humans have found a rainy day activity that will help them interact with nature. They're in the
				middle of making a wind sock. Their usual book didn't provide a very inspiring looking object so they've looked
				through their library and are hoping to create a Japanese streamer, shaped like a fish.</p>
				<img src="resources/images/30DW_streamerBook.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-100" alt="Japanese streamer instructions in book">

				<p>It looked ambitious and I wasn't confident that they could reproduce anything resembling a fish. But they have
				drawn up a reasonable shape on some spare material. Personally, I wouldn't have chosen fabric that colour, but
				they never listen to me.</p>
				<img src="resources/images/30DW_streamerBlank.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image" alt="Japanese streamer template">
				
				<p>One of my little humans is busy colouring it in using fabric crayons. It is taking a while because she is a 
				bit of a perfectionist. The first side is complete, but I might have to wait a while before I can show you the streamer
				blowing in the breeze.</p>
				<img src="resources/images/30DW_streamerColour.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-100" alt="Japanese streamer coloured">
								
				<p>Not only has the other side of the fish got to be coloured, but they've got to sew the pieces together. I hope they
				remember to leave the mouth and the tail unstitched. They need to insert some wire to keep those open and let the
				wind blow through. I'm not even sure they know where they are going to install it...and I doubt they'll want to go outside 
				to attach it anywhere when it's raining.</p>

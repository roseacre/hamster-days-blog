				<p class="lead">A force to be reckoned with.</p>
				
				<p>I think I've made it clear that I live to snack <i>and</i> that my little humans live to gaze for hours at computer
				screens (and in doing that they forget to eat!). The littlest one did that yesterday, but it was in a quest to create a 
				Minecraft Milku.</p>

				<p>Yes, it <i>is</i> a hamster. I was assured that it is. It has a pink nose... It also has the most wonderful cage and 
				environment, but you'll just have to take my word for that as we didn't bother taking a picture of it.</p>
				
				<p>I was flattered by the effort she'd put in to creating all of that. <i>And</i> I was inspired. After all some of those
				Minecraft animals can do amazing things.</p>
				
				<p>Dragging my lightweight treat dish about 10cm into my upper den is a piece of <del>cake</del> carrot. I often do it
				just to tease my humans.</p>
				<p>However, yesterday, I was empowered by my Minecraft alter ego to drag my heavy muesli dish from the upper
				platform, down the ramp and across the cage floor to my main den. I was just foiled by the size of my front door. After all 
				that effort, the dish wouldn't fit through the gap. Talk about disappointed!</p>

				<p>And my humans were just <i>amused</i>. Not sympathetic to my plight. No, they thought it was funny! Well, I got my own 
				back. Oh yes. During the night one of the bigger humans was woken up by a lot of banging noises and thought a 
				neighbour was being noisy. It turned out that it was one of his neighbours...me!...banging my seed bar on the wooden roof 
				of my den!!</p>
				
				<p>Mwahahahaha! (That's me doing an evil laugh. I was told that just saying "ha!" wasn't good enough for a wannabe evil 
				genius.)</p>

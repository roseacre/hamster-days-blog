				<p>Scientists have discovered a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-41161424">
				gene mutation</a> may be responsible for making some dogs "greedy" and prone to obesity.</p>
				
				<p>Some of my humans think I'm putting on weight. Cheek! I know I can clear my bowls of treats and muesli when the
				mood takes me, but it doesn't mean I eat it all. They <i>know</i> that. I like to maintain a larder in case
				I'm dissatisfied with the treats on offer sometimes.</p>
				
				<p>Well, if they accuse me of being a fatty again, I'll just suggest that I'm genetically predisposed to having a large
				appetite. I'm not going to accept the same excuse from them, of course.<p>
				
				<p>I thought my food stash had fermented yesterday and that I was hallucinating...I peeked out of my cage to see a
				medieval archer in the room... It turned out that the <a href="http://saxonarchers.uk/">Saxon Archers</a> were having a
				party and the big fella was wearing clothes that suited the name of the club. He got the prize for having the best 
				costume...but it did give me a fright...</p>
				
				<p>My little humans were out and about yesterday as well. Two of them enjoyed a horse riding lesson at <a href="http://newhillhouseridingschool.co.uk/">
				New Hill House Riding School</a>. It was only a little taster session so they didn't smell too horsey when they came home...
				and weren't too saddle-sore. I'm not sure I'd like to get too close to a horse, but my little humans seem to like 
				large animals.</p>
				
				<p>I've heard one of them wants a pet pig...as long as it's not a <i>guinea</i> pig...</p>

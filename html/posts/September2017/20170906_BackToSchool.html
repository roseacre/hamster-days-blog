			<h2><a href="20170906_BackToSchool.html">Peace at last!</a></h2>
				<p>06-Sep-2017 | Milku</p>

				<p class="lead">The last stragglers have returned to school and work.</p>

				<p>Although I though the new school term started on Tuesday, that was only for my little humans who attend primary school.
				The slightly bigger one had an extra day off. But today, my humans have all vacated the house, if only for a few hours
				of studying and work. I have the run of the place. I can do what I want. I think I'll have a nap...</p>

				<p>I could, of course, read a book because it is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/read-a-book-day/">
				Read a Book Day</a>. Don't tell the little humans. They'll think they have to read a <i>whole</i> book and they'll
				never go to bed. For some of my humans, every day is for reading books. They never have their noses out of books or
				away from their Kindles. If it keeps them away from me, I'm all in favour.</p>
				
				<p>My little humans have been busy putting the finishing touches to their clay creations...I told you they'd get
				all arty after visiting Salts Mill and seeing the Hockney artworks. They all made some models and have just finished
				painting them.</p>

				<p>I especially like the unicorn...beautiful eyes...just like me...</p>

				<br /><br />				
				<p>The little dog is nice too...very smart top hat...</p>
				<p>But I don't know who they used as a model for that face...their Dad wasn't home as I recall...</p>

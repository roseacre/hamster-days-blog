				<p class="lead">And a bottle of water...</p>
								 
				<p>Ahoy, me Hearties! Today is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/talk-like-a-pirate-day/">Talk Like a Pirate Day</a>.</p>
				 
				 <p>I was rudely awoken yesterday evening by a scurvy dog rummaging in my cage. (Not an actual <i>dog</i>, you understand. 
				 I'm trying to talk like a pirate...)</p>
				 <p>As expected, a new water bottle was 
				 being installed. Disappointingly, it was the same as the previous one. My humans claimed the 
				 <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/colortone-hamster-bottle">coloured water bottles</a> were a bit flimsy...
				 It's not as if I was going to gnaw a hole in it. They know I don't vandalise my cage. I don't even gnaw at the chew toys
				they bought me.</p>
				 
				 <p>But, blow me down! There was more...those landlubbers can't resist buying me new things...I know I'm spoiled...</p>
				 
				 <p>They'd acquired a couple of <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/wooden-playsticks-small">wooden playsticks</a>.
				 Really, that doesn't describe them at all. They're a set of little sticks that are bound together into a flexible mat. They <i>could</i> be
				 shaped to make a shelter, but my humans have linked them to make a new ramp for me. It's now easy to get into the roof of my den.
				 I didn't bother much before...took too much effort and my humans rarely left any snacks up there...not after I woke the big fella
				 by banging a seed bar against the wood...</p>

				<p>They've added a bit of colour to one of the platforms. They've hung a 
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/small-pet/rabbit/rabbit-toys/pets-at-home-wooden-bright-stick-mobile-small-animal-toy">mobile</a>
				 that looks like it's made out of multi-coloured ice lolly sticks in a corner. I suppose I'm supposed to do something
				 with it...</p>
				 
				<p>And best of all, I've now got my own "purple box". My little humans had a sweet tub that was replenished with 
				various sweets and treats...and it was always known as the purple box because that's the brand colour for Quality Street...
				</p>
				<p>I had a few nearly empty bags of treats lying around and those have been tidied into <i>my</i> purple box. My humans were
				also tempted by an offer on some new treats (
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/pets-at-home-tasty-triangles-with-linseed-small-animal-toppers-80g">
				linseed triangles</a>, 
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/guinea-pig-treats/pets-at-home-biscuit-bites-with-carrot-small-animal-treats-80g">
				carrot bites</a> and <a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/guinea-pig-treats/pets-at-home-wild-forage-mix-cornflowers-sunflower-petals-small-animal-topper-14g">
				a bag full of mixed petals</a>) and let me try them out yesterday.				

				<p>Delicious! You should try some.</p>

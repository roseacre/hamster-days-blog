				<p>So Everton were too "nice" when they played Tottenham... Hopefully, they'll have put all that behind them as they
				face <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41227367"> Atalanta</a> this evening. I've read that the 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atalanta">Atalanta</a> from 
				Greek mythology was a fierce hunter...hope the Italian version isn't
				quite so strong and resourceful...</p>
				
				<p>Yesterday, it was <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/peanut-day/">Peanut Day</a> and my humans gave me a
				some peanuts as a snack. I do wish they'd start shelling them for me though. They seem to think that I should
				enjoy gnawing the nuts out of the shell...er, why would I want to do that... I insist that the least they do is 
				break a hole in the shell to help me... I haven't got time to waste wrestling with shells. </p>
				<p>At least peanuts are easier to
				carry than pea pods. I tried to carry a pea sideways through my tunnel the other day and it wouldn't fit! I suppose
				I could've changed how I was carrying it, but at the time it seemed easier to change my destination. I just hauled
				my treats down the ramp in my cage instead.</p>

			<h2><a href="20170928_Apollon.html">Everton are in action again.</a></h2>
				<p>28-Sep-2017 | Milku</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">I'd like a win, please, Ronald.</p>
								 
				<p>Apparently, today is the anniversary of William the Conqueror's
				<a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/william-the-conqueror-invades-england">invasion of England</a> 
				in 1066. The Battle of Hastings only took place on 14th October so William and his boys must've done a little
				sightseeing first...</p>
				
				<p>Today is also <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/drink-beer-day/">Drink Beer Day</a>. Now that seems a 
				better thing to celebrate. Indeed, I might be driven to drinking copious amounts of beer this evening...</p>
				
				<p>Once again Everton will take to the pitch in the Europa
				League. Their opponents <a href="http://www.apollon.com.cy/en/apollon-home">Apollon Limassol</a> hail from
				Cyprus so presumably aren't a huge club. But they do have a Liverpool player on loan and you can just guarantee that
				he'd love to score a few goals against the Toffees.</p>

				<p>I haven't even got the hope that Niasse will come on as substitute and rescue the situation. He was out of 
				favour when Everton named their squad for the competition so he can't play.</p>

				<p>Everton matches are becoming as scary as episodes of Dr Who. My humans might have to watch the coverage from behind 
				the sofa. I'll just peek out occasionally from my den... </p>

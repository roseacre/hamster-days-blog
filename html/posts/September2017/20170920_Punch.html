				<p class="lead">Let's celebrate Punch Day!</p>
								 
				<p>Today is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/punch-day/">Punch Day</a>. So it's time to brew up a drink
				with five ingredients...and enjoy! Why five ingredients, I hear you ask. Well, the name comes from the 
				Hindustani word 'panch', meaning five. So a traditional punch recipe will have five key ingredients:
				alcohol (usually spirits), lemon (or other fruits), sugar, water, and tea (or other spices, e.g. cinnamon).</p>

				<p>I'm thinking I might need a extra shot of something in my punch tonight. Everton are in action once again. I'd almost forgotten 
				they were still in the 
				<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/41249724">EFL Cup</a>. I hope they still have being in the EFL up final
				as a goal this time tomorrow. </p>
				
				<p>And if you don't want to drink all your punch, you could store in in a thermos flask in honour of today's
				scientist of the day. <a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/collections/chemistry-calendar/september-20#otdic_content">
				James Dewar</a> was born on the 20th September 1842. One of his achievements was the design of an insulating 
				double-walled flask with a vacuum between two silvered layers of steel or glass...</p>

				<p>Let me ask, did you think of the drink when I mentioned that it was Punch Day? Are you sure you didn't think
				it was going to be an opportunity to hit someone? Or enjoy some traditional 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Punch_and_Judy">seaside entertainment</a>?</p>

				<p>If you took advantage of yesterday's <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/read-a-book-day/">
				Read a Book Day</a>, you might need to participate in today's <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/buy-a-book-day/">
				Buy a Book Day</a>. My humans seem to have discovered Amazon's Prime Reading offers so probably won't be 
				buying anything unless they've got a taste for reading other books by authors they've encountered via Prime...</p>
				
				<p>But books aren't the only thing you need to be aware of today. It's also
				 <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/beer-lovers-day/">
				Beer Lover's Day</a>. I know one of my humans will enjoy that...I wish he was going to be home tonight to share
				his beverage...well, beer <i>is</i> only a drink made from flowers, right?...surely I could have a sip...</p>

				<p>Then if that wasn't enough, you'll have to nip down to the nearest deli because today is 
				 <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/salami-day/">
				Salami Day</a> as well. That should add flavour to the mountain of runner beans that my humans are eating their way through.
				I'm helping, but I do like a bit of variety so can't consume too much of the surplus.</p>

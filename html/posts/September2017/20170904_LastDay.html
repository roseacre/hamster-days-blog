				<p class="lead">That calls for ice cream...</p>

				<p>My humans are just deciding what to do on the last day of the school holidays.
				The little humans just want to vegetate in front of computer screens really, but that's <i>so</i> boring.
				Their Mum isn't putting up with that.</p>

				<p>They had hoped to find a film they wanted to see at the cinema...but one of the little humans had already seen
				Despicable Me 3 and the reviews of the Emoji Movie put them off...</p>
				
				<p>They contemplated a walk along the promenade. <a href="http://www.blackpool-illuminations.net/">
				Blackpool Illuminations</a> were switched on last Friday so, if they
				timed it right, my humans would see a spectacular light show. But they'll need to be in bed early ready for 
				school in the morning so perhaps they should go to see the lights at the weekend. Plus, it's looking a bit dull and
				feels autumnal today and that's putting them off walking out...not even the lure of the ice cream vendors on the prom
				is going to tempt them.</p>

				<p>Thank goodness for the Internet otherwise I'd have been stuck with them all day. They want to visit Tootsie's
				 ice cream parlour at <a href="http://www.botanybay.co.uk/food-hall/#tab2">Botany Bay</a>. They're supposed to have
				 over 150 ice cream flavours to choose from...it might be some time before I see them again...</p>

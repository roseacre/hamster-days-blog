				<p>My travelling humans returned from the North East of England yesterday, full of tales of castles and Roman forts amd more.<p>
				
				<p><a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/prudhoe-castle/">Prudhoe Castle</a> was the only 
				Northumberland castle to resist the Scots, but it couldn't resist my humans. They clambered
				all over it. They enjoyed exploring <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/barnard-castle/">
				Barnard Castle</a> and <a href="http://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/chesters-roman-fort-and-museum-hadrians-wall/">
				Chesters Roman Fort</a> too. All English Heritage sites, which is unusual for my humans. They usually frequent National Trust
				places...and they did that too, of course. They stopped at <a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/acorn-bank">
				Acorn Bank</a> for lunch on their way to the North East. And roamed 
				<a href="https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/allen-banks-and-staward-gorge">
				Allen Banks and Staward Gorge</a> too. Apparently that was a great place for climbing trees.</p>
				
				<p>But it was 
				<a href="https://www.forestry.gov.uk/hamsterleyforest">Hamsterley Forest</a> that was
				their favourite place to visit...it had plenty of climbing opportunities too.</p>

				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170812_HamsterleySign.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="sign for Hamsterley Forest">
				
				<p>I bet you thought such a place didn't exist. There's even a village called Hamsterley...and a Hamsterley Common...
				but we won't dwell on that as it doesn't sound as upmarket as I'd like.</p>
				
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170812_Hamsterley.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="Hamsterley Forest">
				
				<p>There were forest trails to explore and lots of play areas. My little humans built a den in the woods and
				played pooh sticks.</p>
				
				<p>They added to their collection of photos of interesting signs too. The first one here they spotted in the Youth
				Hostel in Swadlincote. The other was in Hamsterley Forest.</p>
				
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170812_ToiletSign.jpg" class="resized-image-45" alt="sign in a youth hostel toilet">
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170812_PooFairy.jpg" class="resized-image-45" alt="poo fairy sign">
				<br /><br />
				
				<p>Hamsterley Forest is unlucky if it doesn't have a poo fairy. There's one here...every so often all the poo in my cage 
				disappears. She also takes my food stash too...unless that's her friend the Food Pilfering Pixie.</p>

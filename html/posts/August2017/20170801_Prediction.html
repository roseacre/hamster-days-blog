				<p>01-Aug-2017 | Milku</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">But my humans don't believe me.</p>
				
				<p>My humans put some pictures beside me while I was exercising in my cardboard box...yes it's still going strong even
				if I always try to gnaw through the corners when I'm in it. Well, I wasn't too concerned. They keep trying to find new ways
				to entertain me. This time, however, they seemed to think that by choosing one of the pictures I would predict 
				the winner of Thursday's football match between MFZ Ru탑omberok and Everton.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170801_milku.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="Milku with pictures of Ru탑omberok and Everton crests">
				
				<p>I've told you my dilemma before. The MFK Ruzomberok badge reminds me of Lancashire's 
				<a href="http://www.lancashirevillages.com/redrose/">red rose emblem</a>. The colour red is eye-catching so naturally
				I stopped to look at that. And you'd think think I'd committed a heinous crime. My humans assume that I'm predicting
				that Ru탑omberok will win. Not at all. I have every faith in Koeman's boys. But I am an Evertonian and it doesn't
				always pay to expect too much. This time, I <i>am</i> expecting Everton to progress to the next round of the Europa League
				competition. Honest! </p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170801_milku2.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="Milku">
						
				<p>I can't wait for the match actually. It means that some of my humans will be back from another trip. The one who is
				staying behind had better look after me well...or I'll be telling tales!</p>

				<p class="lead">It's Tell a Joke Day.</p>

				<p>Today is 
				<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/tell-a-joke-day">Tell a Joke Day</a>. Now this doesn't stop you telling jokes 
				on any other day of the year, but you can get away with it today...especially if your joke-telling is as dodgy as my
				humans' efforts.</p>
				
				<p>Brace yourselves...</p>
				
				<p>The children begged for a hamster, and after the usual fervent vows that they would care for it, they got one. 
				They named it "Danny".</p>
				<p>But two months later, when Mum found herself responsible for cleaning and feeding the creature, 
				she decided to find a new home for it.</p>
				<p>The children took the news of Danny's imminent departure quite well, though one of them remarked, 
				"He's been around here a long time, we'll miss him."</p>
				<p>"Yes," Mum replied, "But he's too much work for one person, and since I'm that one person, I say he goes."</p>
				<p>Another child suggested, "Well, maybe if he wouldn't eat so much and wouldn't be so messy, we could keep him."</p>
				<p>But Mum was firm. "It's time to take Danny to his new home now," she insisted. "Go and get his cage."</p>
				<p>With one voice and in tearful outrage the children shouted, "Danny? We thought you said Daddy!"</p>

				<p>And if that wasn't enough for you...here's another...</p>
				
				<p>On her fifth birthday, Kayleigh finally got a pet hamster.</p>
				<p>He was loved and well cared for, but still managed to escape from his cage. The family turned the house upside-down 
				and finally found him. Phew!</p>
				<p>Several weeks later, while Kayleigh was at school, he disappeared again. But after a frantic search, the hamster
				couldn't be found. Hoping to make the loss less painful for Kayleigh, her Mum took the cage out of her room.</p>

				<p>When Kayleigh came home from school that afternoon, she climbed into her mother's lap. "We have a serious problem," 
				she announced. "Not only is my hamster gone again, but this time he took his cage!"</p>

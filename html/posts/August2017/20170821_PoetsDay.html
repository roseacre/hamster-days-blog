			<h2><a href="20170821_PoetsDay.html">How can today be Poets' Day?</a></h2>
				<p>21-Aug-2017 | Milku</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">It's only Monday...</p>

				<p>I've heard that today is 
				<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/poets-day/">
				Poets' Day</a>. Now, I've heard my bigger humans mention this, but in relation to them leaving work early on a Friday,
				because tomorrow is Saturday. But it's only Monday...I'm confused... And there's no need to leave anywhere early today.
				It's the summer holidays...and the Manchester City versus Everton kick off time is a late one...</p>

				<p>But if today is a day to honour the writers of bards and sonnets and the like, I haven't found any who have taken
				a hamster as their muse. It's disappointing.<p>
				<p>I do think, however, that Robert Burns <i>could</i> have been writing about a hamster when he penned
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/To_a_Mouse">
				"To a Mouse, on Turning Her Up in Her Nest With the Plough"</a> in 1785...if only he'd been farming in Syria rather than
				Scotland...</p>
				
				<p>Doesn't "Wee, sleekit, cow'rin, tim'rous beastie" make you think about hamsters? No? How about if I translate it
				to "Little, artful, cowering, timid beast"? That's me to a T.</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, enough of this. I'm hoping that Wayne Rooney is poetry in motion tonight as Everton beat Man City...
				It's the start of the football season..even an Evertonian can still be optimistic at this early stage.</p>

				<p class="lead">But the Newton house at school had mixed fortunes in sports day.</p>

				<p>Did you know that Sir Isaac Newton's <i>Philosophi√¶ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> 
				was first published on 5 July 1687. That's a long time ago. At least students of Newton's laws of motion
				and his law of universal gravitation don't have to read about them in the original Latin. I'd find the theory difficult to 
				understand in English...although I understand the practical aspects of it all very well...the bigger and nearer that a 
				treat is to me, the stronger its attraction. And I'll definitely remain at rest whenever possible unless a human hand 
				starts to try to grab me!</p>
				
				<p>I thought yesterday's school sports day would be postponed. I noticed that it was raining as I went to bed. But as my
				littlest human said, "footballers play football in the rain so we'll be able to do sport when it's wet". They were lucky that
				the rain stopped for a couple of hours so nobody got wet...unless they fell over when doing the sack race. 
				Apparently, my little humans raced very well. They're fast...like me. So I wasn't surprised to hear that
				they competed in the final relay race too. I've
				seen a photo of my littlest friend crossing the finishing line in first place. Well done to the Clifton team.</p> 

				<p>It's an exciting day today too. I'm counting down the hours until my little human comes home from Poland. 
				I can't wait to hear all about Polish food...oh, and all about the sights too I suppose.</p>

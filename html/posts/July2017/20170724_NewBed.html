			<h2><a href="20170724_NewBed.html">I love my Pets@Home Totally Tropical Bed.</a></h2>
				<p>24-Jul-2017 | Milku</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">But I couldn't eat a whole one.</p>
				
				<p>Yesterday evening I was given my new
				<a href="petsathome.com">Pets@Home</a>  
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/pets/totally-tropical-small-animal-wave-square-bed-small">
				Totally Tropical Bed</a>. My humans put it in the old cardboard box I run around while they clean my cage and waited
				for me to notice it. That didn't take too long. I was most intrigued.</p>
				
				<p>A quick sniff around the edge was all it took to persuade me that it was worth investigating further. I
				scrambled over the side and sank into the lovely padded cushion. There is a lower entrance at the front of the bed,
				but I prefer climbing in over the sides.</p>
				
				<p>But why stop at just resting in comfort...I wanted to know what was underneath the cushion. Had someone left any
				snacks down there? I used my claws and my teeth and burrowed down. Great fun! I don't think my humans were too impressed
				that I'd made holes in the cushion within 5 minutes. I hadn't let the stuffing out so I don't know what the problem is!</p>

				<p>My humans had thought that they could put this new bed in the den area of my Alexander Cage. But it's too bulky for that. 
				It'd be a bit tricky for me to get in and out of it without bumping my head on the den roof. So I still snuggle down to sleep in
				a lovely kapok nest. Instead the new bed has been positioned under one of the wooden platforms in my cage, where it is hidden from
				view by a ramp. It'll be great for a pit-stop while I'm roaming around during the night.</p>
				
				<p>The bed is a lovely turquoise colour. But there is a bit of a choice with the cushion. One side is purple. 
				But I prefer the turquoise side with its colourful zig-zag lines. As it's on display (sort of) it'll add a bit 
				of necessary colour to my cage too.</p>
							
				<p>I knew my humans would try giving me yogurt to taste. Just because some other hamsters like it doesn't mean that we
				all do. It didn't look good and I ignored the dish. They even tried to dab a bit on my mouth to <i>make</i> me taste 
				it. No success for them there...I'm far too clever for that...just keep moving if you're ever in the same situation.</p>

				<p>And just to remind you that, today is the start of 
				<a href="https://www.awarenessdays.com/awareness-days-calendar/national-parks-week-2017/">National Parks Week</a>.  
				My humans have a couple of trips to different National Parks lined up for the holidays...but during other weeks. 
				They need to learn to plan their jaunts a bit better.</p>

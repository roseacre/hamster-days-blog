				<p class="lead">Maybe hamsters have a different sense of humour to humans.</p>

				<p>My humans think the above cartoon is very appropriate for me. 
				I have to admit that I don't do a lot of exercising in my wheel when they're around. I don't use it much 
				when I'm by myself either...I view it more as a novelty toilet for occasional use...</p>

				<p>I was very proud of my little humans today...they graduated! They're not some child prodigies who have
				attended college early or anything. No, it was a <a href="http://www.childrensuniversity.co.uk/">
				Children's University</a> graduation, where children are awarded different
				certificates, degrees and diplomas for completing different extra-curricular activities. Their hours of 
				swimming and Brownies and the like all add up. So my little friends acquired gold degrees. They got to dress up 
				in lovely blue caps and gowns with lots of their school friends. And all threw their caps in the air at the end.
				It sounds like great fun.</p>
									
				<p>I have to tell you that I tasted some peas for the first time yesterday. I stuffed them quickly into my cheek pouches
				along with a few other tasty morsels so my humans aren't really sure whether I liked them or not. As far as they
				know I might have simply spat them out in disgust in my den. But I can confide in you, can't I? Those peas were
				rather nice. Far better than the strawberries they tried to get me to eat.</p>

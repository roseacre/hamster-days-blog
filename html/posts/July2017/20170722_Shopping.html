			<h2><a href="20170722_Shopping.html">They took the hint.</a></h2>
				<p>22-Jul-2017 | Milku</p>
				<br>
				<p class="lead">My humans have bought me a lovely new bed...and some delicious muesli.</p>
				
				<p>I think my humans must secretly read my blog. They've taken the hint I left in my last post about 
				<a href="petsathome.com">Pets@Home</a> having some lovely new 
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/pets/totally-tropical-small-animal-wave-square-bed-small">
				beds</a> in stock. They showed me their purchase yesterday. It looks <i>so</i> soft and comfortable. But they
				haven't let me have it yet. OK, so I was a bit reluctant to get up yesterday and they didn't want to disturb me.
				Plus, they want to clean my cage out first. I'll be able to give my review of the bed soon...I hope...</p>

				<p>But that wasn't the only thing they bought. They purchased some new muesli for me. They've obviously noticed that 
				I'm not too keen on some of the things in the last bag of food...those yellow flakes...yuk!</p>
				
				<p>This time I'm trying   
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/shop/en/pets/harry-hamster-complete-muesli-700g">
				Harry Hamster Complete Muesli</a>. Now Harry seems to know just what a hungry hamster wants. Plenty of seeds, Big, chunky pieces.
				Plenty of flavour. I dived into my bowl straight away. I even ignored the dish of treats. And that has <i>never</i> happened before.

				<p>I think I like the summer holidays if it gives my humans more time to go shopping for me. If only they wouldn't add
				strange things to my exercise box to try to entertain me...pink bunnies...whatever were they thinking...I don't care if it
				did come all the way from Poland.</p>

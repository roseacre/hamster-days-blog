				<p>I've finally stopped celebrating after the Lionesses beat Scotland six-nil on Wednesday. I didn't expect that. 
				Now, I'm looking forward to seeing how they fare against Spain on Sunday.</p>

				<p>I've just discovered Neil Armstrong was the first person to step on the moon 48 years ago today. I do enjoy looking
				at the moon and I know that animals have been into space, but I have no ambitions in that direction. I like my home
				comforts. And I've spotted some lovely 
				<a href="http://www.petsathome.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/en/pets/totally-tropical-small-animal-wave-square-bed-small">
				beds</a> in the <a href="petsathome.com">Pets@Home</a> VIP Pets newsletter. I'm hoping that my humans will head 
				to the shops soon and make me even more comfortable.</p>

				<p>My little humans are all breaking up for the school holidays today. Actually, one completed Year 8 yesterday, but
				she's reasonably quiet...plugged into her headphones and laptop or phone...so I don't notice her too much. I hope they
				are going to go out a lot so I'm not disturbed during the day. At least they're not going to put me in kennels or anything
				while they go off on a long holiday. But I don't think I'll get as many interesting treats if the big man is home alone. 
				I suppose it'll be September soon enough and we'll be back in the usual routine.</p>

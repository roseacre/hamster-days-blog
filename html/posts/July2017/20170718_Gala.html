				<p>I'm hoping for good news later. One of my little humans has been participating in school swimming gala
				today and I'd like to think that her efforts will have helped her school to win something. I <i>know</i> that
				it's the taking part that counts really, but <i>I</i> prefer to win if at all possible. And there is a spare birthday
				cake in the kitchen from last weekend...if our school has been victorious there's a chance that the cake might
				be cut!</p>
				
				<p>Today is   
				<a href="http://www.rsc.org/learn-chemistry/collections/chemistry-calendar/july-18#otdic_content">Robert Hooke's
				birthday</a>. He won't be sharing our cake as he was born in 1635, but we'll celebrate on his behalf.
                Hooke gave his name to Hooke's Law...you think he'd have been a bit more imaginative...which states that 
                'the force exerted on a spring is proportional to its extension'. I think I've been experiencing something like 
                that in my cage...my extendable tube seems to drop a bit lower than it used to when I go inside it. I wonder
                if it's because I'm heavier? I want to put on record that I'm not over indulging on snacks, of course. It's just
                a natural weight gain because I've been growing up.</p>
                
                <p>And just for completeness, so you don't think Robert Hooke was a one trick pony, 
                he also wrote a book on microscopes, made Robert Boyle an air pump so that he could study gases and 
                coined the biological term ‘cell’.</p>

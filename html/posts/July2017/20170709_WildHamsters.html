				<p>I've been reading a  
				<a href="http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2014/03/07/hamsters-origins-syrian-aleppo-animals-world-pets/">
				National Geographic article</a> about hamsters. I knew that Syrian hamsters were first taken into captivity in 1930, but
				it's been interesting to learn that their existence was first documented, in 1797 by physician Alexander Russell, 
				in a publication called "The Natural History of Aleppo"". It'll be the 220th anniversary of that sometime this year. I must
				insist on having a celebration...maybe some cake...</p>
				
				<p>I was more surprised by the details of the 1930 capture of my ancestors. Israel Aharoni had to dig down 
				8 feet (2.4 meters) to find a hamster family. I'm going to have to put an extension to my cage on my wish list. I'm never
				going to get touch with my wildness if I can only burrow for a few centimetres.</p>
	
				<p>At least my humans have been trying to tantalise my tastbuds. They came home from Blackpool's 
				<a href="http://www.wilko.com/">Wilko</a> shop with some new snacks. The locust bean treats didn't look too
				appetising, but they tasted good. I also got a new little biscuit that had a surprisingly soft centre. It's supposed
				to taste like tropical fruit. Whatever it is, it was good.</p>
				
				<p>A bit more worrying is the fact that as my humans were buying these tasty treats, a fellow shopper told them
				that her hamster loves yogurt. Now, I just know that I'm going to get a bowl full of the stuff one of these days.
				Just because one hamster likes it doesn't mean we all will.</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, I think the next new taste coming my way is going to be a pea...and maybe a jostaberry... I'll let you know 
				what I think of these offerings from our garden next time.</p>

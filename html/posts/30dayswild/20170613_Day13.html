				<p>13-Jun-2017 | Milku</p>

				<p class="lead">We're trying to get colours from nature.</p>

				<p>It's Day 13 of    
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a>.</p>

				<p>My humans thought they’d see whether any of the vegetation in the garden would produce some natural dyes. 
				It was very optimistic in my opinion, but points for trying.</p>
				<p>They picked sage, rosemary and mint, put each herb 
				in a pan of water and boiled for about an hour. At first the aroma was pleasant, but after a while some of my 
				humans thought they were living through an episode of Horrible Histories.</p>

				<br /><br />
				<p>They did produce some unpleasant coloured liquids in which they soaked some cloth. The results were <del>subtle</del> 
				disappointing. They were expecting green hues but got more pale beige. Still, they were keen to try again 
				and consulted <a href="https://www.thespruce.com">thespruce.com</a>, which provided lots of details about how to
				produce colourful dyes from different plants.</p>

				<br /><br />
				
				<p>Well, using carrots produced even worse results than the herbs. But the black grapes produced a really lovely
				purple colour.</p>

				<br /><br />

				<p>And all was not lost with the herby liquids. They’d spotted a recipe online for a rosemary and sage facial toner. 
				While it didn’t state that the herbs should be boiled until gruesome, they mixed up the liquids and tried it anyway.</p>

				<p>Rosemary is known for its astringent, disinfectant, and antioxidant properties, it is great for combatting acne.
				Garden sage is antiseptic, antibiotic, anti-fungal and astringent.
				They sound great – maybe my humans should bath in the stuff! </p>

				<p>Of course, <i>I</i> don’t need anything like that. 
				You can see I have a perfect complexion already.</p>

				<p>My humans are quite pleased that it's day 29 of  
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a>. It means that the challenge is nearly complete.
				It's not that they don't like nature, but it is difficult for them to get close to it on week days during term time.
				They intend to #StayWild at weekends and during the holidays...they promise.</p>
				
				<p>So what can I talk about today? It is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/international-mud-day/">
				International Mud Day</a>. After all the rain we've just had, there should be plenty of mud around for my humans
				to interact with. But I'm not convinced that they like getting grubby, unless they're enjoying a session
				with the <a href="https://weareadventurers.co.uk/">We Are Adventurers</a> folks.</p>
				
				<p>When gardening, my humans haven't spotted any fairies living at the bottom of the garden. However, something is
				living down there and creating interesting artwork using the leaves of the rose bushes.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/30DW_chewedLeaves.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="rose leaves that have been eaten by pests">
				
				<p>If only my humans could spot the culprit. It might give them an interesting picture to share for 
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a> and help them stop it happening.</p>
				
				<p>The only other option, is to show you a picture of a clay owl that one of my little humans made. It
				<i>isn't</i> modelled on any of the Brown Owls or Tawny Owls that my little Brownie knows. But her Brownie
				pack did have a visit from some real owls recently so maybe it is a model of the snowy owl that she held.</p>

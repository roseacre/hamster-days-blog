				<p>It's Day 12 of    
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a> and we're finding it hard to get involved with
				nature in the middle of Blackpool. It doesn't look like any creatures have moved into our bug hotel. The spider
				catcher hasn't enticed a spider to set its trap there. And it doesn't look like our rainwater is spawning any
				new life. But there's always the option of growing something new.</p>

				<p>The primary school that my little humans attend is starting to do gardening again. They’ve added a 
				big greenhouse to the grounds and have plans to create a wild garden. To get ready for Professor Sprout’s 
				herbology classes…OK maybe the professor doesn’t teach at the school…my little girls begged some compost, 
				pots and seeds from their mum and set to work. They also decided to grow some seeds in an old eggbox just 
				as the <a href="https://wordery.com/rspb-365-outdoor-activities-you-have-to-try-dk-9781409348191?currency=GBP&gtrck=dlh2TGxyUmYyYzZBMFMrQ2pucDRnTkhoQmlQSHNRbTBickVSclB2S2RlYnB2bVlYY2RyN3hqdUZsYUJhYW9KWUo4NWNQSDdPNHFITUpyRWl0dm1iYmc9PQ&gclid=CjwKEAjw07nJBRDG_tvshefHhWQSJABRcE-ZgDITYMM_UQ2em-8F1ddg1xWaNiNSfdCngpxVvz9f5BoCB13w_wcB">

				<p>They filled the pots and divided up the seeds. They sowed cress in the eggbox.</p>

				<p>Rainbow chard and parsley have been planted in small plant pots.</p>

				<p>They soaked the pots in water to give the seeds a good start and then set them aside to germinate.</p>
				
				<p>And because I insisted they actually show you something they've grown, I have to tell you that they 
				planted the seeds 10 days ago. They checked how things were growing after a week, but had to wait until today
				before the parsley had grown enough to show you.</p>
				
				<p>After a week, the cress was growing well and the rainbow chard had germinated.</p>

				<p>I've no idea what rainbow chard tastes like, but it sounds colourful. No doubt I'll have to try some unless
				someone can tell my humans that it isn't good for me.</p>
				
				<p>After 10 days, the parsley is growing, but the cress is starting to look less vibrant. I did taste that.
				I can't say I'm a fan, but it was OK.</p>

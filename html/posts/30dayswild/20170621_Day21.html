				<p class="lead">We've used eggs to condition our hair.</p>

				<p>The quest for human beauty continues on Day 21 of    
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a> as my humans have been trying to improve
				the condition of their hair. I reminded them that <i>my</i> fur is beautifully maintained and that <i>I</i> didn't require the 
				application of any of their concoctions. Amazingly, they did take notice and one of the smaller humans volunteered for
				the treatment.</p>
				 
				<p>Her sister acquired a couple of eggs, cracked them into a bowl and made sure they were well beaten.</p>

				<p>The willing <del>victim</del> volunteer, brushed her hair and allowed her Mum and sister to rub the beaten eggs into
				her hair and scalp.</p>

				<p>They they covered the hair with a towel and left the eggs to work their magic. A period of half an hour was
				recommended, but the little human <i>had</i> to finish watching a film before she'd rinse her hair so I think the
				treatment lasted over an hour.</p>

				<p>You're probably wondering why they chose to use eggs. Due to their high levels of Omega-3 fatty acids, xanthophylls, 
				immunoglobulins, vitamins and other micro-nutrients, eggs are supposed to be good for strengthening the hair and hair 
				follicles. My humans also expected the hair to become less frizzy and grow faster. They are so optimistic!</p>
				 
				<p>I think it worked...a bit. All the hair straightening and the like that goes on has left quite a bit of damage so 
				the process will have to be repeated many times. They should just follow the same beauty regime that I have...
				avoid using any products and just complete a daily run through their fur with their fingers and spit.</p>

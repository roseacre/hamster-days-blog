				<p>It's Day 7 of    
				<a href="http://www.mywildlife.org.uk/30dayswild/">30 Days Wild</a>. I can't believe we've been doing this for a 
				week already. My humans are planning to venture into the wild weather later so hopefully will have something
				interesting to report. In the meantime, they've been working indoors, checking out logs.</p>
				
				<p>Be assured that my humans didn’t chop down a tree just to complete this activity. Oh no. They’d salvaged some 
				tree trunks from where a garden was being cleared. Actually they wanted them for their wood burning stove, but 
				cutting them into logs so they could see the tree rings would help prepare for them having a nice warm house some 
				time.</p>

				<p>Our <a href="https://wordery.com/rspb-365-outdoor-activities-you-have-to-try-dk-9781409348191?currency=GBP&gtrck=dlh2TGxyUmYyYzZBMFMrQ2pucDRnTkhoQmlQSHNRbTBickVSclB2S2RlYnB2bVlYY2RyN3hqdUZsYUJhYW9KWUo4NWNQSDdPNHFITUpyRWl0dm1iYmc9PQ&gclid=CjwKEAjw07nJBRDG_tvshefHhWQSJABRcE-ZgDITYMM_UQ2em-8F1ddg1xWaNiNSfdCngpxVvz9f5BoCB13w_wcB">
				book</a> of suggestions gave us a few thoughts on what to do with these lumps of wood.</p>
				
				<p>Activity #187 – guess a tree’s age – as different tree species grow at different rates each year you can find 
				out the approximate age of a tree by measuring around the trunk and dividing the girth by the average 
				growth rate. Just one stumbling block for my humans with this one…they weren’t sure what sort of tree they 
				were dealing with. But have guessed at it being a beech tree.</p>
				
				<p>They measured a circumference (or girth) of about 15 inches. They had to use inches given the website they'd
				found with beech tree growth rates was an American one and it wanted measurements in inches. It suggested our
				tree was about 19 years old.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/30DW_treeAge.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-45" alt="website showing tree age">

				<p>So they moved on to Activity #232 – counting tree rings to guess the age of the tree. One light ring plus one 
				dark ring equals a year of a tree’s growth. It was difficult to count them and my little humans were glad they 
				only had small tree trunks to deal with.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/30DW_countingRings.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-45" alt="child counting tree rings">
				<p>After a couple of re-counts, the little humans thought the tree was 20 years old.</p>
					
				<p>Then they tried reading the weather rings – activity #188.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/30DW_log.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-45" alt="closeup of tree rings">
				
				<p>Apparently, the width of a tree ring tells you what the weather was like when the tree was growing. Narrow rings 
				suggest the tree was short of water. Wide rings mean that the tree got lots of water. I think some trees will have 
				nice wide rings this year. And they did spot a few differences in the width of the rings.</p>

				<p>Not content with just using the big lumps of wood, the humans got creative too with some of the smaller branches.
				They cut tiny discs off.</p>

				<p>They sanded them smooth.</p>

				<p>And they decorated them.</p>

				<p>With the addition of a bit of varnish, they look great.</p>

				<p class="lead">I tried to decide on a better alias than "The Hamster".</p>
				
				<p>I'm often shown <a href="http://www.dilbert.com">Dilbert</a> cartoons. Don't tell anyone, but my humans seem to think
				that their work places are very similar to Dilbert's! What they don't realise is that the rise of a hamster
				leader is predicted within the cartoons...</p>

				<p>I don't really like to be thought of as a <i>rebel</i>. I might go along with the notion of being a 
				<i>non-conformist</i>, albeit only in a non-religious sense...but I don't want to offend anyone. I'll go
				with <i>maverick</i>. It makes <i>me</i> think of James Garner, Mel Gibson and Tom Cruise. So <i>you</i> 
				can think of me as a free-thinking heart-throb...I can dream...</p>
				
				<p>It's often thought that you need technology to establish a power base these days. As you can see,
				I am perfectly placed to assume my predicted leadership role.</p>
 				<img src="../../resources/images/20170516_milku.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image" alt="Milku with laptop">
 				
				<p>However, I think I need a better moniker than "The Hamster". It's  a bit too obvious. No butch enough. I'll
				keep pondering the problem...unless you can think of something appropriate?</p>
				
				<p>Oh, hang on...you don't think Dilbert was foreseeing the rise of 
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Hammond">Richard Hammond</a> do you? He's good, I'll admit, 
				but he's no rodent. And I do prefer James May... I was looking forward to being in charge too.</p>

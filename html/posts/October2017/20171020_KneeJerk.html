				<p>20-Oct-2017 | Milku</p>

				<p class="lead">Dig out your braces not your suspenders...</p>

				<p>Today's <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/word-of-the-day">word of the day</a> is 'knee-jerk'. 
				 And I have to admit to expecting some knee-jerk reactions from Evertonians, if not the Everton Board.
				  I know that the manager has received the backing of Everton's major
				 shareholder, but I'd be considering other employment options if I was him...</p>
				 
				 <p>Here, I'll point out that every Everton manager since the turn of the century has had more than 100 games 
				 to prove their worth. Koeman still has a lot more games available to him if he <i>is</i> given 100 in charge. But
				 They can't keep losing! I'm a nervous wreck...well I am naturally skittish, but the recent poor 
				 Everton results just don't help matters.</p>
								 
				<p>Now, I'm finally sure that the website I so enjoy looking at is American. Ooh, I thought,  
				 <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/suspenders-day/">Suspenders Day</a>. 
				 I might just have the legs to carry that off... </p>
				 <p>But on closer inspection the day is celebrating the use of 
				 <i>braces</i> to hold up trousers. Now, I know that some humans have braces on their teeth, but the strange
				 harness like things, that humans wear when they don't want to use a belt to hold up their clothes, are
				 also called braces...NOT suspenders! </p>
				 <p>Don't you just love the English language and how the same words mean different things.</p>

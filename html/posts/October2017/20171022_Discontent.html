				<p class="lead">Everton...results...need I say any more?</p>
				
				<p>I've been told that far back in history...well, 1984 may seem like yesterday to you, but is 
				prehistoric to me...there was a young Everton manager who was on the brink of 
				dismissal. But then...a cup game...a Kevin Brock back pass...Inchy scored...and 
				<a href="https://thesefootballtimes.co/2016/01/27/in-celebration-of-howard-kendall-and-evertons-class-of-85/">
				Howard Kendall</a> retained his job and led Everton to some great times...</p>
				
				<p>But this Sunday! Even during a <i>normal</i> season, you might think that Everton would struggle to beat Arsenal.
				But, up pops Rooney and the Blues are a goal ahead! Sadly, it didn't last. </p>
				<p>Can Koeman survive? Well, there is a 
				cup game on Wednesday. Could this be a turning point that fans will wax lyrical about in decades to come?
				Are Everton on the brink of league and cup glory?</p>
				
				<p>Well, that'd be nice, but I don't really expect Chelsea to make the same sort of error that led to Everton 
				beating Oxford United in 1984...Bear in mind that stranger things <i>have</i> happened...so I'm not heading
				off to the bookies to bet on the identity of the next Everton manager just yet... </p>

				<p>Instead, I've been contemplating   
				 <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/mole-day/">Mole Day</a>. It's a time-limited event.
				 You should only participate in Mole Day activities between 6.02am and 6.02pm.</p>
				 
				<p>It's not a celebration of my animal friends. Instead, it celebrates Avogadroâ€™s Number (6.02 x 1023), 
				 which is a basic measuring unit in chemistry. For a given molecule, one mole is a mass (in grammes) whose number 
				 is equal to the atomic mass of the molecule. </p>
				 <p>Happy Mole Day, to all you chemists out there.</p>

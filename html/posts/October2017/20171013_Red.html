				<p>13-Oct-2017 | Milku</p>

				<p class="lead">Shouldn't cause problems...touch wood.</p>
								 
				<p>So today is Friday the 13th. Some humans are a bit superstitious about it apparently.
				However, the <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41012571">people interviewed by the BBC</a>
				mostly thought it wasn't an issue.</p>
				
				<p>I'm not superstitious, but there are plenty of wooden ramps in my cage so I'm virtually always touching wood.</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/20170722_milku.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="Milku">
				
				<p>Now, I'd spotted an angry bird picture of the <a href="https://www.evertonfc.com/">Everton website</a>, 
				with the headline 'Red is a Blue, 
				but had not really stopped to check what it was all about. I have to admit that I thought it was quite clever though.
				Almost on a par with the second Everton shop being in the Liverpool One shopping area...Everton Two, Liverpool One...Nice!</p>
				<img src="../../../resources/images/redIsABlue.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image-60" alt="Red the Angry Bird in an Everton shirt">
				
				<p>So it turns out that Rovio are now 
				<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-4892272/Everton-sign-shirt-sleeve-sponsorship-Angry-Birds.html">
				sponsors of Everton's shirt sleeves</a>. Surely there wouldn't be a problem...
				but it has caused some 
				<a href="http://www.101greatgoals.com/news/social/everton-fans-fume-angry-birds-sponsor-reminds-liverpool/">
				consternation</a>,  with fans expecting a flash of red on the Everton shirt...something that would be abhorred.
				However, it's the Angry Birds logo and not a red bird that's going to be added to the shirt sleeves. Panic over.</p>
				
				<p>Anyway, those Blue boys need to roll up their shirt sleeves, even if it means hiding new logos,
				 and battle hard for a win on Sunday.</p>

				<p class="lead">It's actually <i>Fair</i> Trade Month.</p>
								 
				<p>Someone said October was Fur Trade month. My humans had better not get any ideas! </p>
				<p>What?...oh, my mistake...
				it's <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/fair-trade-month/"><i>Fair</i> Trade month</a>.</p>
				
				<p>My little humans have got the option of testing out an Ethical Consumer activity for the Girl Guides. They could have
				done something involving fair trade. But I think they've chosen to look at the alternative Emergency Action challenges. 
				I hope looking after <i>me</i> during an emergency is top of their priorities.</p>

				<p>I can't even begin to think about Everton's result against Burnley...So the Everton manager has the 
				<a href="https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/everton-farhad-moshiri-ronald-koeman-095554756.html">full support</a>
				of the Everton chairman...that usually means a P45 is in the post... 
				</p>
				
				<p>And finally, today is <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/name-your-car-day/">Name your car day</a>. One of my humans
				has given names to some of her cars. One was Paisley and another was O'Hara...because of their colours...I don't have to 
				spell it out for you, do I?</p>
				<p>Milku would be a fine name for a car...I just don't want it being applied to the drab grey vehicles in this household.</p>

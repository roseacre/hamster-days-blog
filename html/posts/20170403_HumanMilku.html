				<p class="lead">...I'd be good-looking and popular...obviously!</p>

				<p>Last week, my smallest human contemplated what I'd look like if I was a human.</p>

				<p>She was inspired by the Harry Potter books that she's reading at the moment to suggest that I'd have ginger hair and freckles. She imagines that I'd look like one of the Weasleys.</p>

				<p>I'm not saying that's a bad thing, but I don't really have red hair and my complexion, if you could see it under all my fur, is flawless.</p>

				<p>I'd say my hair would be a sandy colour, in a close-cropped style. I'd be handsome. Of course! My twinkling brown eyes would make everyone fall in love with me. I'd have a cheeky grin, albeit that I might need some dental work on my front teeth! I'd be popular. But in all honesty, I couldn't claim that I'd be the centre of every social situation by choice. I'd value my privacy and only be seen out with trusted companions.</p>

				<p>I wonder whether an actor's life would suit me? I hear that I've just missed out on the perfect part, that of Sulu the hamster in the new Captain Underpants film. I'd be available for the sequel...I'll just brush my fur and wait for Hollywood to call.</p>

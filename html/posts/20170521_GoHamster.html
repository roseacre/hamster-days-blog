				<p class="lead">A new approach to outdoor adventures.</p>
				
				<p>It seems that Saturdays are becoming my day of rest. I didn't manage to log on to my computer yesterday. 
				No point. The Seasiders (<a href="http://www.blackpoolfc.co.uk/">Blackpool Football Club</a> to the uninitiated) 
				won't play until next Sunday. And the Premiership football matches for the last day of the season are only being 
				played today...so I'm keeping one of my beady eyes on the latest scores...come on Blues!</p>
				
				<p>I was a bit too tired to type if I'm honest. The vacuum cleaner woke me up during a wonderful
				dream...I was lounging on the sofa watching Katy Perry videos on TV and my humans were all running in large 
				wooden wheels to generate the electricity...if only...</p>

				<p>It wasn't a restful day for one of my human friends either. She was on day 2 of celebrating her friends'
				birthdays. Two sleepovers in quick succession! I bet she'll be in bed early tonight so one less trying to cuddle me.
				Yesterday, she was at <a href="https://goape.co.uk/">Go Ape</a>, enjoying adventures in the outdoors. 
				Apes wouldn't make <i>me</i> adventurous, but humans must be spurred on to challenge themselves by the thought of ugly-
				looking primates.</p>
				
				<p>'Go Hamster' would be a better concept in my opinion. OK, so we don't do a lot of swinging, but we're quite
				adept at climbing and love burrowing.</p>
				<p>Sport Blackpool have built the 
				<a href="https://www.blackpool.gov.uk/Residents/Sports-and-leisure/Outdoor-activities/Activities/Highropes.aspx">
				Outdoor Revolution</a> to Stanley Park. It's not just high ropes and low ropes. They've got an underground
				tunnel experience too. But did they use hamsters as part of their branding? Oh no. They've called it a 'Mole Hole'.
				My humans tell me that it's great fun, but I'm sure it must be scary for some. Maybe they need a 'Hamster Burrow' 
				as well.</p>

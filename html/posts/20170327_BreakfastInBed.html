				<p class="lead">Call me lazy, call me cheeky, but breakfast in bed is my preferred option.</p>

				<p>If the male human isn't in charge, I often get a dish of treats left next to my furry Emours den on one of the upper platforms in my cage. I particularly like carrots and sunflower seeds, but I won't turn my nose up at such tasty morsels as parsnip, mushroom, dried banana and walnuts. Saying that, I do hope that they vary the menu a bit more soon. I have been offered apple and grape, but I think they got the message that I wasn't keen after I left those things untouched.</p>

				<p>Now, I don't get the treats if the big fella is in control of feeding. I heard him say that he didn't want me to <i>expect</i> to get tasty tidbits. I notice, however, that he's always treating himself. Just give me one day in charge and I'll show him!</p>

				<p>You might think that it's perfectly acceptable for me to tuck in to my treats in full view of my human family. And I will on occasion indulge their need to see me feeding. However, I do prefer to savour my snacks at my leisure in the privacy of my den. Hauling my loot in my cheeks is do-able, even if I want to hide it in my ground floor appartment. But it is a bit of a chore.</p>

				<p>So, I gave them a hint that I wanted breakfast in bed. After the snack bowl appeared, and no one was looking, I dragged the entire bowl into my furry den. It blocked the entrance, but who cares! I've been working on creating a rear entrance to the den. It's taken a couple of weeks but I managed to bite and scrape through one of the seams at the back. An escape hatch!</p>

				<p>They commented that I was being cheeky and moved the bowl out of the den, albeit not before I'd snaffled a few of the seeds. I was determined to dine in comfort so dragged the bowl back into the den. Get the message! Bring the food to me. Don't expect me to go to the food.</p>
				
				<p>Is it too much to ask for a bit of equal treatment? I've seen my humans delivering drinks and snacks right into another human's hands. <b>Equality For Hamsters!<b></p>

				<p class="lead">So your hamsters have some tasty treats.</p>
				
				<p>The 17th May is my new favourite day. It's 
				<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/world-baking-day/">
				National Baking Day</a>. And my humans haven't disappointed me. They have been baking and I can share
				some tasty new hamster treat recipes with you.</p>
 				<img src="../../resources/images/20170517_milku.jpg" class="centred-image resized-image" alt="Milku trying to climb out of cage">
 				
				<p>Once again, the details are a bit sketchy. I told my humans that you might want to hear about
				specific quantities of ingredients, but they just don't listen to me. You'll have to forgive me, but 
				I didn't spend too much time trying to discuss the recipes with them. I'm the chief taster so I'm really
				only bothered about the finished product and its flavour. How it was achieved is of little interest. 
				After all, <i>I'm</i> not going to get a chance to do any baking myself.</p>
				
				<p>So here we have <b>Recipe 1</b>. Actually, it's the fifth treat recipe they've created, but we'll start the 
				count again for this post. You can look in my archives to get April's <a href="20170411_Cooking1.html">
				cooking post 1</a>,
				<a href="20170412_Cooking2.html">cooking post 2</a> and <a href="20170413_Cooking3.html">cooking post 3</a>.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Oats</li>
					<li>Broccoli</li>
					<li>Omega seed mix</li>
					<li>Cheese</li>
					<li>Egg</li>
				</ul>

				<p>Thene there's <b>Recipe 2</b>. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Bran flakes</li>
					<li>Broccoli</li>
					<li>Dried mango</li>
					<li>Sunflower seeds</li>
					<li>Home made yogurt</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Finally, here's <b>Recipe 3</b>. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mushrooms</li>
					<li>Mealworms</li>
					<li>Dried banana</li>
					<li>Omega seed mix</li>
					<li>Peanut butter</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Apparently, they put all the ingredients in a food processor and mix until they have a mixture they
				can mould into little pellets.</p>
				<p>The treats don't look too attractive. They've still got to work on their 
				presentation skills, but after about 10 to 15 minutes in the oven at about gas mark 4, they taste great.</p>
				
				<p>The ingredients suggested are just ones that I enjoy. Really you can get your humans to blend
				the stuff you like eating. They just have to make sure that they form cheek pouch sized treats.</p>

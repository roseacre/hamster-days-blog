				<p class="lead">It has got to come out.</p>

				<p>In his 1938 memoir, The Summing Up, W. Somerset Maugham (1874-1965) wrote: 
				"There is an impression abroad that everyone has it in him to write one book; but if by 
				this is implied a good book the impression is false."</p>

				<p>Now you might be wondering why I'd quote something like that...well, November is 
				<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/novel-writing-month/">
				Novel Writing Month</a>. And I'm sure I have a good novel in me...I couldn't help myself...it was left 
				near my cage...I started nibbling and that was it...!</p>

				<p>It'd probably be tastier than the pumpkin my humans keep trying to feed me. I sampled the first batch out of 
				politeness, but now they need to move on. Halloween is over. And pumpkin pies don't feature highly on menus in
				Blackpool.</p>
				
				
				<p>I wondered why my humans were all home yesterday...recovering from celebrating an Everton victory
				snatched from the jaws of a draw, I thought. But no, it was the last day of the half term holidays and they were too
				idle to go out and leave me in peace. </p>
				<p>To be fair, they had been out on Sunday, trying out 
				<a href="http://kaspas.co.uk/location/preston/">Kaspa's</a> in Preston. They couldn't bring me any ice cream or
				waffles, but they did shop for some treats for me. It's just a shame that I have to wait for them. Apparently,
				they're going to make me an advent calendar.</p>

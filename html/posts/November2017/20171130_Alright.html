				<p>Well, I hope life as an Evertonian is going to be all rosy.</p>
				<p>What a change in form! The return of a former manager obviously spurred the team on to score and beat				
				<a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42075946">West Ham</a>! A lovely hat-trick by Rooney.</p>
								
				<p>Or were the players all trying to impress their new boss who was watching from the stands. If I was Mr Unsworth, I'd
				be a bit peeved that they hadn't played so well in other games.</p>
				
				<p>So...Sam Allardyce... My big humans didn't seem too thrilled but they'll support him if he manages to sort out the 
				immediate problems with the team. They'll just bide their time and look forward to a future with a fantastic new
				stadium on the Liverpool waterfront, a glamorous manager inspiring the team to win every tournament...oh, and Liverpool
				Football Club languishing in League One...</p>
				
				<p>Actually, they'd prefer the Reds to be in the National League, but don't want to be too greedy!</p>

				<p>However, my humans were not impressed by the prospect of welcoming former Red, Sammy Lee, along to Goodison to help 
				Big Sam save the day. But if 
				<a href="http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/everton-legend-kevin-ratcliffe-no-13975209">Kevin Ratcliffe</a>
				says it's OK... I'm not so sure they should listen to someone called 'rat' though...</p>

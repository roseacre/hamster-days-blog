				<p>Black Friday? I'm not going to get involved in a shopping frenzy. I'm hoping that my humans will buy me
				everything I want. Instead, I'm going to promote <a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/buy-nothing-day/">
				Buy Nothing Day</a>. It's far better for your bank balance and stress levels.</p>
				
				<p>Of course, stress levels in my house aren't doing so well after yesterday's football results. We knew that
				Everton couldn't progress to the next round of the Europa League, but still had hopes that they would try to win the
				match. We were disappointed. Losing by five goals to one to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/42085410">Atalanta
				</a> wouldn't be great at any time, but it somehow makes it worse that it happened at Goodison Park, Everton's home ground.</p>
				<p>Of course, I believe that the place was half empty, but no one can blame the fans for not venturing out on a miserable
				autumn night if the team might be expected to lose. Definitely a "Black Thursday".</p>
				
				<p>And I thought my blog's monochrome colour scheme would be accessible. However, it seems that the contrast levels
				aren't up to the required levels. It's probably because the background of the banner isn't uniformly black. 
				If I'm changing things, I may take the opportunity to introduce a bit of colour. I'd ask my little humans for
				suggestions, but they're battling over the colours for the feature walls in their bedroom...and none of their
				favourites sound suitable for my requirements.</p>

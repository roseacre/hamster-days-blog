				<p>My littlest humans enjoy some fine school dinners. The school catering team can tempt them to try things they
				wouldn't touch at home.</p>
				
				<p>This week they're looking forward to a "Best of British" lunch.
				While our European neighbours might sneer at some examples of British cuisine, there are many meals that could
				have appeared on the menu, but, this time, the school are celebrating the great British breakfast...and my little humans
				can demolish plates full of bacon and sausage.</p>
				<p>Our school must be having this special school dinner event because it's   
				<a href="https://www.awarenessdays.com/awareness-days-calendar/national-school-meals-week-2017/">
				National School Meals Week</a>.</p>
				
				<p>Apparently, parents are encouraged to cook a school meal recipe and send in a photo of it. I hope my big humans 
				realise that they should attempt contemporary recipes and not ones dating from <i>their</i> school days. 
				Leathery liver and onions...tapioca pudding...they weren't popular then. There's no way modern children would even 
				try them.</p>
				
				<p>My humans have a head start on the dessert. The little 'uns all made banana cake at their
				<a href="https://www.st-mary.blackpool.sch.uk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1584&Itemid=937">
				Create It, Make It</a> sessions. They tried to persuade me to have a taste, but frankly, my dears, I wasn't keen.
				It's a good job that the big fella will eat my share...</p>

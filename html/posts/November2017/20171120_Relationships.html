				<p>This week take some time to develop relationships with your animals. It's 
				<a href="https://www.daysoftheyear.com/days/human-animal-relationship-awareness-week/">Human-Animal Relationship Awareness
				Week</a>.</p>
				<p>My week has started off with lots of attention. I got my cage cleaned out.</p>
				<p>I just hope my humans seek to develop our
				relationship by plying me with lots of treats. I need to replenish the larder that was disposed of with my bedding!</p>

				<p>I had an great opportunity to bond with my little humans at the weekend. They all decided to have a sleepover with me...
				Not in my cage you understand...they bedded down alongside it. They couldn't sleep in their bedroom because it was being painted.</p>
				<p>Now, I was tempted to run on my wheel all night to keep them awake, but I'm not like that...</p>
				<p>I don't mean that I'm considerate. I'm just a bit too lazy to do that much exercise. Everything in moderation unless it's
				snacking!</p>

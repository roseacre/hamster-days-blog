				<p class="lead">Forget books and TV shows, gaming is where it’s at.</p>

				<p>Hamsters have scampered off the pages of books and away from TV screens and found their way on to computer monitors
				and various gaming devices too. I’ve mentioned previously that <b>Hamtaro</b> has starred in video games as you might 
				expect from a Japanese creation. </p>
				<img class="centred-image resized-image" src="../../resources/images/HamtaroGame.png" alt="cover of Hamtaro Game" />				
				 
				<p>Those ZhuZhu pets were good at spreading their paws into that entertainment genre too. 
				Look out for the <b>ZhuZhu Pets</b> video game on Nintendo DS, iPhone, and PC. 
				<b>ZhuZhu Pets 2: Featuring The Wild Bunch</b> can be played on Nintendo DS and Wii. 
				You’ll have to have a Nintendo DS though if you want to play <b>ZhuZhu Pets: Kung Zhu</b>, 
				<b>ZhuZhu Princess: Carriages & Castles</b> or <b>ZhuZhu Puppies</b>.</p> 
				<img class="centred-image resized-image" src="../../resources/images/zhuzhuPetsGame.jpg" alt="cover of ZhuZhu Pets game" />

				<p><b>Hamster Monogatari 64</b> is a life simulation game for the Nintendo 64 where the player must raise and look after 
				hamsters. It was only released in Japan, but I think there are lots of hamster owners who should try that game out 
				<i>before</i> they head to Pets@Home to buy a real hamster.</p>

				<p>Video games are where hamsters have found their niche. There are many other gaming hamsters out there.</p>

				<p>Boo is Minsc's animal companion in the <b>Baldur's Gate</b> series of games.</p>
				
				<p>Jogurt is a small hamster-like creature in <b>Shining Force</b>. I won't be buying this game as Jogurt is considered to be 
				a "joke character" who remains perpetually weak even after joining the player's group.</p>
				
				<p>Minsc in <b>Tiny Brains</b> is a blue hamster and one of the game's four playable characters. 
				Used as a lab experiment by humans, he has the unique ability to create solid platforms in midair.</p>
				
				<p>Newton in <b>Flying Hamster</b> is player character who flies using a propeller made from a leaf shoot to rescue 
				his girlfriend Sookie from a giant eagle. I'm not sure about the <i>girlfriend</i> bit but I wouldn't mind having a go at flying.</p>
				<img class="centred-image resized-image" src="../../resources/images/flyingHamster.jpg" alt="Flying Hamster game"/>
				<p>Rick the Hamster from <b>Kirby's Dream Land 2</b> is one of Kirby's animal companions. 
				He is able to jump up walls and carry Kirby on his back.</p>
				<img class="centred-image resized-image" src="../../resources/images/kirbysDreamland.jpg" alt="cover of Kirby's Dreamland 2 game"/>
				
				<p>It all sounds a bit too energetic for me. I'm heading back into my den for a nap!</p>

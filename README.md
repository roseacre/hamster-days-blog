# hamster-days-blog
Repository to 
- support the development of an online blog (hamstedays.eu.pn) and
- test new technologies as part of ongoing training.

Initially this will comprise a very basic website, using Javascript, HTML, CSS.

Different technologies will be deployed over time in order to practice web development and prepare a better product. 
Plus the intention is to use this project to learn new skills.
